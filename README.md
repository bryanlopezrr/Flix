### Notes
One of the challenges I encountered while working on this application was understanding 'Storyboard' Swift mobile application development. Initially, I tried to complete the assignment with the latest SwiftUI without any success. 
Another challenge I faced was properly making the network connection to get the data from the API, towards the end by Googling some of the questions I was able to push through and gain some valuable knowldege.
